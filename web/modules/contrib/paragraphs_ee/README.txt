-- SUMMARY --

The "Paragraphs Editor Enhancements" adds some styling to the modal dialog used
by Paragraphs [1] and to "Add In Between" provided by Paragraphs Features [2].
The module allows you to group Paragraph types in the modal dialog using
categories and uses the images you can add to each Paragraph type for better
recognizability.


-- REQUIREMENTS --

* Paragraphs [1]
* Paragraphs Features [2]


-- INSTALLATION --

Install as usual, see the documentation page about installing modules [3] for
further information.
To make use of the re-styled dialog, configure your Paragraphs widget to use the
modal dialog for adding paragraphs to your content ("Add mode" -> "Modal form").
Enable add in between buttons to see a better editor experience in the widget.
